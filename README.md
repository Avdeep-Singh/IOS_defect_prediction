# iOS Update Risk Assessment Model

This project investigates the potential risk associated with updating to a new iOS version based on synthetically generated data. It aims to help users make informed decisions about updating their devices by analyzing the relationship between various factors and update success.

## Data Acquisition and Exploration

The project utilizes two synthetically generated CSV files:

- `ios.csv`: Contains data about iOS versions and their impact on various aspects of device performance.
- `pred.csv`: Contains data for new or upcoming iOS versions to be assessed for update risk.

**Note:** Due to privacy and security concerns, the actual datasets used in this project are not publicly available. If you'd like to explore replicating this analysis with your own data, please contact me at avdeep2001@gmail.com for further guidance.

The code performs the following initial steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Pandas library (`pd.read_csv`) is used to read both CSV files.
2. **Data Shape:** The code prints the dimensions (`data shape`) of the loaded dataframes to get an idea of the number of rows and columns.
3. **Data Head:** The `head()` method displays the first few rows of each dataframe to provide a glimpse of the data content.
4. **Data Summary:** The `info()` method provides summary information about the data, including data types and existence of missing values.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Missing Value Handling:** The code replaces missing values with `0` (consider exploring alternative strategies depending on your data and modeling approach). The resulting dataframe is stored in `mydataset_without_null`.
- **Feature Selection:** The code creates a new dataframe `data_copy` by dropping the target features (`ios version` and `total_bugs`). These features will not be used as predictors in the model.

## Model Development

The core functionality of the project involves iterating through each feature in the data (`data_copy`) and training a Gradient Boosting Classifier model (`GradientBoostingClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`) to predict whether updating to a specific iOS version would lead to issues (represented by a binary classification task).

**Key Steps in the Loop:**

1. **Feature Selection:** The loop iterates through each column (feature) index `i` (from 0 to 52) in `data_copy`.
2. **Data Separation:**
    - Target variable (`y`): Values from the current feature column (`data_copy.iloc[:, i].values`).
    - Feature variable (`x`): Values from the last column (`data_copy.iloc[:, 53].values`) representing the iOS version (reshape to a 2D array for the model).
3. **Model Training:** A Gradient Boosting Classifier is trained (`fit`) on the separated data. Hyperparameters like `n_estimators` (number of trees), `learning_rate`, and `max_depth` are set within the model creation (you can experiment with different values to potentially improve performance).
4. **Prediction on New Data:** The trained model is used to predict update risk for the data in `pred.csv` (excluding the `ios version` column). The predictions are stored in `pred`.
5. **Error Handling:** The loop includes a `try-except` block to handle potential errors during training and re-run the process for the problematic feature.

**Global Variables:**

- `summ`: Accumulates the first prediction value from each iteration, used for overall risk assessment.
- `heatmap_list`: Stores all individual predictions for visualization as a heatmap.

## Model Evaluation

- **Heatmap Visualization:** The predicted update risk for each feature-version combination is visualized as a heatmap using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. This can help identify potential patterns in update risk across different features and iOS versions.

- **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is generated using `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` to compare the actual update outcomes (assumed to be in `actual_list`) with the model's predictions (`heatmap_list`). This helps assess the model's ability to correctly classify update risks.

- **Accuracy Score:** The overall accuracy of the model is calculated using `sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score`.

- **Risk Assessment:** Based on the accumulated prediction values (`summ`), a basic risk assessment is provided (High, Medium, or Low) for updating to the new iOS versions in the `pred.csv` data.

## Additional Analysis

- **Correlation Analysis:** The code calculates Pearson correlation coefficients between certain features (e.g., `slow performence`, `Battery`, and `ios_version`) using `scipy.stats.pearsonr`. This can provide insights into potential relationships between features.

## Limitations

- The model's accuracy is dependent on the quality and completeness of the historical data.
- It assumes a binary classification of update risk (risky/not risky).
